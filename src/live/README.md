# Live trading (placeholder)

This folder is a placeholder for future **paper/live trading** modules (e.g., Binance Testnet).
Suggested next steps:
- Add a position sizing module (fixed fraction, volatility targeting)
- Add order execution wrappers (market/limit) for Testnet
- Add a scheduler/runner for real-time loops
